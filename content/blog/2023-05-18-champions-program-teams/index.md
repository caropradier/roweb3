description: "Introducing Champions and Mentors - Marcos Prunello and Lukas Wallrich"
---

*We designed the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees alike. In our program, each Champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.*

*In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.*

Meet **Marcos Prunello** from Argentina and **Lukas Wallrich** from United Kingdom!

We're excited to have both Pao and Adam be part of the Champions program and can't wait to see what this partnership yields. Stay-tuned for the next series of introductions ðŸ˜‰ .
